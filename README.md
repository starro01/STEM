Welcome to the home of the Super NOVA path.  It is the intent of this site to
eventually have a complete set of steps that any boy scout can follow to obtain
the Super NOVA award.  In order to accomplish this task, each of the award
activities needs to be detailed and a step by step process completed.

We are looking for contributors.  If you are interested in contributing, please
feel free to fork this repo and make poll requests.  If you wish to send me the
updates, please feel free to contact me.


Project Layout
==============

This project has (or will have) a .md file for each award.  That file will
contain the detailed steps to complete the award, leading to the Super Nova
Award.  Contributers please look at the files and make updates to the links a
scout would follow to complete the award.

Nova Awards are in the following format:
  1.  Read or Watch and formulate questions
  2.  Merit Badge List
  3.  Research
  4.  Activities
  5.  Project
  6.  Counselor Discussion

At this time, I would like to get get a lengthy list of You Tube videos and
articles completed for the watching and reading tasks, links for the research, links to help complete the
activities.


Future Goals
============

At some point in the future I would like to create an open rails app to allow a
scout to create an account and walk the scout through the process.
