Welcome to the home of the Super NOVA path.  It is the intent of this site to
eventually have a complete set of steps that any boy scout can follow to obtain
the Super NOVA award.  In order to accomplish this task, each of the award
activities needs to be detailed and a step by step process completed.

We are looking for contributors.  If you are interested in contributing, please
feel free to fork this repo and make poll requests.  If you wish to send me the
updates, please feel free to contact me.
