This module is designed to help you explore how science affects your life each
day.

1.  Watching and Reading on the following topics: projectiles, aviation,
    weather, astronomy, or space technology.
  1.  Spend 3 hours watching and reading from the following links:
    * list here   <----- Need help
    * Wanted You Tube videos:  see the above topics list   <----- Need help
    * Wanted Articles on the above topics   <----- Need help
  2.  Mentor Discussion
    1.  Compile your list of questions from A.
    2.  Choose two and discuss them with your mentor.

2. Complete one of the following Merit Badges:
    * Archery
    * Astronomy
    * Athletics
    * Aviation
    * Rifle Shooting
    * Robotics
    * Shotgun Shooting
    * Space Exploration
    * Weather

3.  Explain the difference between escape velocity, orbital velocity, and
    terminal velocity.
    1.  Use the following links to understand these terms:
      * Escape Velocity: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity
      * Orbital Velocity:  http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed
      * Terminal Velocity: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity

    2.  Answer these two questions and discuss with your counselor:
      1. Why are satellites usually launched toward the east, and what is a launch
       window?
      2. What is the average terminal velocity of a skydiver? (What is the fastest
       you would go if you were to jump out of an airplane?)

4.  Satellites
    For this activity, you will attempt to find satillites in the night sky.
    1.  Decide where you will be doing your observations.
    2.  Got to http://www.heavens-above.com.
      1.  Follow the "Change your location link" and set your viewing
location. (Make sure you click on update.)
      2.  Choose one of the listed satellites.  This link will provide the exact
          times and location in the sky.
    3.  Watch the satellite using binoculars.  Record the time of your viewing,
        the weather conditions, how long the satelite was visible, and the path
of the satelite.
    5.  Discuss with your counselor.

5.  Activity and Experiment
    For this activity, we will build a marble run or roller coaster that will
include an empty space where the marble has to jump from one track to another.
    1.  Keep track of your experimental data for every attempt.  Include the
        vertical angle between the two parts of the chute and the horizontal
distance between the two parts of the chute.  Include pictures of the device for
each attempt.
    2.  Experiment with different starting heights for the marble.
      1.  How do the starting heights affect the velocity of the marble?
      2.  How does the starting height affect the jump distance?

6.  Discuss with your counselor how science affects your everyday life.
